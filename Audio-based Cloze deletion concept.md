Thanks for clarifying. I’ll research scalable, audio-based quizzing methods for serious B1–B2 language learners using a speech-based spaced repetition system. The goal is to find alternatives to cloze deletions and translations that:

- Require minimal setup per card (ideally automatable with LLMs)
    
- Encourage active speaking and test grammatical patterns and vocabulary
    
- Work for whitespace-tokenized languages compatible with OpenAI and Google TTS
    
- Use LLM-based answer grading to allow for flexible user responses
    

I’ll look into techniques used in applied linguistics, language pedagogy, and SRS tools, and report back with strategies tailored to your needs.

# Scalable Audio-Based Quiz Strategies for B1–B2 Language Learners

Designing a spaced repetition system (SRS) for serious intermediate learners that uses audio prompts and spoken answers requires moving beyond basic front/back flashcards. Below are several **translation-free, audio-centric quiz techniques** that encourage active recall and speaking practice. These methods can be largely automated (with the help of LLMs for generation and grading) and scale to thousands of words or grammar patterns extracted from native content.

## 1. Active Recall via Audio Cloze Deletions

**What it is:** Present a sentence in the target language via text-to-speech (TTS) with a key word or phrase omitted (replaced by a sound or pause). The learner must **say the missing word aloud** to complete the sentence. This is an audio version of cloze deletion (“fill-in-the-blank”) practice.

**Why it works:** The surrounding sentence context forces recall of vocabulary or grammar in a meaningful way. It’s entirely in the target language (no translation needed) and prompts active _spoken_ recall instead of passive recognition. This mimics how learners recall words when speaking continuously, not as isolated L1 translations.

**Automation:** It’s straightforward to generate cloze cards in bulk. For each target word or structure identified in a native sentence, automatically blank it out. For audio, one can have the TTS skip or say a placeholder (e.g. “___” or a beep sound) at the blank. _Example implementation:_ Use an SSML tag or insert a short recorded silence/“beep” in the TTS output at the missing word’s position.

**Example:** If the original sentence is _“El niño **juega** en el jardín.”_ (“The boy **plays** in the garden.”), the prompt audio might say: _“El niño ___ en el jardín.”_ (with a beep or silence for “juega”). The learner hears this and **responds by saying** “juega” to fill the blank. The system then checks the spoken response:

- **Prompt (TTS):** “El niño _**beep**_ en el jardín.”
    
- **Expected answer (spoken):** “juega” (the missing word, spoken in Spanish).
    

**LLM-based grading:** Since learners may respond with slight variations (e.g. including the whole sentence or using a conjugated form), an OpenAI GPT model can evaluate if the **missing content was correctly produced**. This provides flexibility beyond exact string matching – the LLM can recognize the correct word even if the learner added extra words or minor conjugation differences, and still mark it as correct. (Notably, Anki add-ons have begun using OpenAI to grade typed answers with flexible matching, and the same idea extends to spoken answers after speech-to-text.)

**Tip:** Focus cloze deletions on the **specific new word or grammar element** you want to reinforce. This ensures there’s a single clear correct answer. Audio cloze cards are especially powerful for high-frequency context phrases and collocations, training the learner to _produce_ them on cue.

## 2. Monolingual Definition Prompts (No Translations)

**What it is:** Instead of using an English translation, present a **target-language definition, description, or synonym clue** for a word and have the learner say the correct word that fits that definition. Essentially, it’s a flashcard where the _prompt_ is a brief explanation in the target language, delivered via TTS, and the _answer_ is the vocabulary item – spoken by the learner.

**Why it works:** This approach eliminates translation and forces the learner to **think in the target language**. It mimics how a native speaker might recall a word from a description. For intermediate (B1–B2) learners, using monolingual definitions is a known effective strategy to deepen vocabulary knowledge. Flashcard expert Gabriel Wyner notes that once you can handle it, hearing a definition in the target language and recalling the word is extremely powerful for long-term retention (though it can be challenging at first). This method reinforces understanding of the word’s meaning _in context_ rather than by one-to-one translation.

**Automation:** Definitions or explanatory prompts can be generated in bulk using dictionaries or LLMs:

- **Dictionary API or Corpus:** For each target word, fetch a short dictionary definition in the target language. Alternatively, take the sentence where the word appeared and have an LLM produce a concise definition or synonym in that language (to ensure the correct sense is targeted).
    
- **TTS Prompt:** Use Google TTS to speak the definition. Ensure the definition is _simple enough_ for a B1–B2 learner to grasp from audio alone. If needed, an LLM can simplify overly technical dictionary definitions into more learner-friendly phrasing.
    

**Example:** Target word: _“torre”_ (Spanish for “tower”). The card would use a Spanish definition:

- **Prompt (TTS):** _“Sustantivo. Construcción más alta que ancha, aislada o que sobresale de un edificio.”_ (a Spanish definition meaning “Noun. A construction taller than it is wide, isolated or protruding from a building.”)
    
- **Expected answer (spoken):** _“torre.”_
    

The learner hears the definition and must **say “torre” out loud**. This tests whether they fully understand that description.

If the definition is hard to catch on first try, the system can allow the learner to replay the audio prompt (e.g. a voice command or button to repeat) – as Wyner notes, sometimes hearing a monolingual definition a few times is needed to grasp it. Over multiple reviews, the learner gets better at parsing and recalling quickly.

**LLM-based grading:** Here the expected answer is usually a single word or a set phrase, so grading is simpler. Even so, the LLM can handle minor variations (e.g. if the learner included an article or said a synonym). The model can confirm if the spoken word matches the intended term, accounting for pronunciation errors or slight deviations. If using speech-to-text, one can also directly compare to the known answer, but the LLM could be a backstop for cases where speech recognition is imperfect (e.g. to distinguish _close_ incorrect answers from correct ones phonetically).

**Benefits:** Monolingual definition cards are highly **scalable** – you can generate them automatically for thousands of words. They push learners toward _thinking in the target language_ and provide meaningful speaking practice: the learner is essentially doing quick **target-language “Jeopardy!”** – hearing a clue and producing the word. This method complements cloze cards: cloze tests recall in a specific sentence, while definition cards test recall of the concept in general.

## 3. Contextual Q&A Cards from Native Content

**What it is:** Turn sentences or facts from native materials (videos, articles, etc.) into **question-and-answer prompts**, delivered in audio form. The TTS will ask a question _in the target language_ about the content, and the learner must **answer aloud in the target language**. The questions are designed such that the _answer is contained in the original content_ (ensuring there’s a correct answer to recall). Essentially, you’re quizzing comprehension of the content in a way that forces the learner to produce part of the answer.

**Why it works:** This approach transforms passive content into an active recall exercise. It’s similar to a reading/listening comprehension quiz, but done via audio and speech. It reinforces understanding of context and encourages the learner to formulate answers in their own words (or recall the exact phrasing). Unlike a traditional front/back card that might just show a sentence to recognize, a Q&A card requires **production** – the learner must actively retrieve information and say it. This is aligned with classic _question-answer drills_ in language learning, known to build proficiency through repeated Q&A practice. It also echoes Pimsleur’s “challenge-response” principle: you _anticipate_ the answer and speak it, rather than just passively reading a translation.

**Automation:** You can generate Q&A items with the help of an LLM or simple templates:

- **LLM approach:** Provide the native sentence or a short passage to an LLM and prompt it: _“Formulate a question in [target language] that is answered by this sentence, and give the expected answer.”_ For example, input: “María compró un coche el lunes.” -> LLM could output Q: “¿Qué compró María el lunes?” A: “(Compró) un coche.” This way, you automatically get logically paired questions and answers.
    
- **Template approach:** Identify key elements in the sentence (subject, object, time, place) and use simple templates like “Who…?”, “What…?”, “When…?” etc. in the target language. This works best for straightforward factual sentences. An LLM is more flexible and can handle a variety of sentence types and phrasing.
    

Each card stores the question text (for TTS) and the expected answer text (for reference and grading). The audio prompt is then generated by TTS reading the question.

**Example:** From the sentence _“María compró un coche el lunes.”_ (“Maria bought a car on Monday.”), you can derive multiple Q&A cards:

- **Prompt (TTS):** _“¿Quién compró un coche el lunes?”_ – (“Who bought a car on Monday?”)  
    **Expected answer:** _“María (compró un coche el lunes).”_ – The learner would respond _“María.”_ (or _“María lo compró.”_).
    
- **Prompt (TTS):** _“¿Qué compró María el lunes?”_ – (“What did Maria buy on Monday?”)  
    **Expected answer:** _“Un coche.”_
    
- **Prompt (TTS):** _“¿Cuándo compró María un coche?”_ – (“When did Maria buy a car?”)  
    **Expected answer:** _“El lunes.”_
    

The learner listens to each question and **speaks the answer in Spanish**. Even if the expected answer is short (“un coche”), saying it out loud ensures they actively recall and produce the vocabulary. The context is entirely in Spanish, so they’re not translating from English – they are listening and responding as they would in a conversation or quiz show.

**LLM-based evaluation:** Because there are often multiple correct ways to answer (e.g. _“María compró un coche el lunes.”_ vs just _“María.”_ for the “Who” question), a GPT-4/3.5 model can evaluate the **meaning** of the learner’s response. It can check if the essential information is present and correct. For instance, for “¿Qué compró María…?”, if the learner answers _“Compró un auto.”_ (using a synonym _auto_ for _coche_), a naive exact match would mark wrong, but an LLM can recognize that _auto_ = _coche_ (car) and still mark it correct. This flexible grading ensures learners aren’t punished for minor wording differences. It also encourages them to answer in full sentences if they want, without fear – the LLM will still understand the correctness.

**Scaling benefits:** You can generate numerous Q&A cards from any content. This is great for **mining YouTube transcripts or articles** – for each statement containing a new word or structure, create a question about it. It **augments cloze deletions**: where a cloze targets a specific word, a Q&A card checks understanding of the whole statement and related vocab (all in one exercise). These cards also feel like a mini-dialog: the app asks something, the learner responds, giving a more _interactive_ experience.

## 4. Grammar Transformation Drills (Speech-Based)

**What it is:** This technique prompts the learner to **transform a sentence or phrase** in some way and say the new form aloud. The transformations can target grammar patterns you want to reinforce – for example: changing tense (present to past), switching from affirmative to question form, making a sentence negative, converting direct speech to indirect, changing formality or number, etc. Essentially, the system gives an instruction and a base sentence (via audio), and the learner must produce the modified sentence using the correct grammar.

**Why it works:** Transformation drills have a long history in language teaching for ingraining grammar rules. By _actively manipulating_ a sentence, the learner practices applying grammar in a controlled way. For intermediate learners, this bridges the gap between recognizing a grammar pattern and _producing_ it correctly in speech. Importantly, it’s done in the target language context without defaulting to L1 explanations. The speaking element forces the learner to actually _pronounce_ the changed form, which aids retention and fluency.

**Automation:** You can automate these drills by defining transformation rules or by using an LLM:

- **Pre-set patterns:** Identify common transformations that are useful (e.g. present↔past, singular↔plural, active↔passive voice, statements↦questions, etc.). For each target sentence, decide which transformation to apply. This could be random or based on the content (e.g. if the sentence is in present tense and you know past tense is a learning goal, use that).
    
    - Programmatically, some simple changes (like adding a question word or changing a verb ending) can be done, but for reliability it might be better to use an LLM to ensure the transformed sentence is grammatically perfect.
        
- **LLM approach:** Provide the original sentence to an LLM with an instruction like _“Output this sentence in the past tense.”_ or _“Rephrase this statement as a yes/no question.”_ The LLM can generate the transformed version. You would then have the system store the original as context and the LLM’s output as the expected answer. You can even have the LLM generate the _prompt wording_ in the target language to play via TTS. For example: _“Di la frase en pasado: El niño juega en el jardín.”_ (“Say the sentence in past tense: The boy plays in the garden.”) and the expected answer “El niño **jugó** en el jardín.”
    

**Example transformations:**

- _Tense change:_
    
    - **Prompt (TTS):** _“Di en pasado: ‘El niño juega en el jardín.’”_ (“Say in past tense: ‘The boy plays in the garden.’”)
        
    - **Expected answer:** _“El niño jugó en el jardín.”_ (changed _juega_ -> _jugó_).
        
- _Form a question:_
    
    - **Prompt (TTS):** _“Pregúntame si el niño juega en el jardín.”_ (“Ask me if the boy plays in the garden.”)
        
    - **Expected answer:** _“¿El niño juega en el jardín?”_ (intonation rising, essentially the yes/no question form).
        
- _Polite form:_ (if target language has formal address)
    
    - **Prompt (TTS):** _“Dilo de forma cortés: ‘Abre la puerta.’”_ (“Say it politely: ‘Open the door.’”)
        
    - **Expected answer:** _“Por favor, abra la puerta.”_ (using formal _usted_ command).
        

The learner hears the instruction and original sentence, and **speaks the transformed sentence**. This tests quick application of a rule they know.

**LLM-based evaluation:** Because the expected output is fairly constrained (there’s usually a correct transformed form), the LLM’s job is mainly to check for correctness and not penalize minor deviations:

- It can verify that the **intended change occurred** (e.g. the verb tense changed, or the question syntax is correct) and that no meaning was lost except what was intended (for instance, if forming a question, the LLM checks that the learner’s response is a properly formed question about the same content).
    
- The LLM can tolerate synonyms or slight rewordings as long as the grammar target is satisfied. For example, if prompted to ask politely, the learner might say _“¿Me haría el favor de abrir la puerta?”_ – a more roundabout polite request. A well-designed LLM prompt can recognize this as a correct polite version, even though it’s not the exact expected sentence, and mark it as correct (perhaps even give bonus feedback for creativity).
    

**Scaling & creation:** To generate many such cards, you could have an LLM scan your content sentences and suggest worthwhile transformations. For instance, if a sentence is in present tense, create a past-tense card; if a sentence is affirmative, create a negation or question card. This can be done in batch. The advantage is these **don’t require manual crafting** of exercises – the content itself provides raw material and the LLM “wraps” it into a drill. This keeps prompt creation fast and low-effort.

**Value:** These drills ensure that the learner isn’t just passively recognizing grammar patterns but _actively using_ them. Over time, this leads to more automatic and fluent production of correct forms. And since the medium is speaking, it simultaneously builds oral fluency.

## 5. Open-Ended Speaking Prompts with LLM Feedback (Scenario Practice)

**What it is:** For even more **free-form speaking practice**, you can include prompts that ask the learner to respond to a _scenario or question_ with no single “correct” answer – then use the LLM to **evaluate the response’s quality**. This goes beyond typical flashcards: it’s like a mini conversation or speaking exercise integrated into SRS. For example, the TTS might pose an open question or task (in the target language), and the learner must speak a brief response using relevant vocabulary or grammar. The LLM then judges the response on certain criteria (e.g. did it address the prompt, use the target word, grammatically correct, etc.) and provides feedback or a pass/fail rating.

**Why it’s meaningful:** This approach pushes the learner to **produce language creatively**, much like they would in real dialogue. It can be considered an **augmentation** to normal flashcards – useful for serious learners who want _speaking fluency_, not just memorized answers. It also takes advantage of the LLM’s strengths in understanding nuance. As of 2025, language apps are already exploring conversational AI: for instance, Duolingo introduced AI chatbots to let learners practice without fear of mistakes. In our case, we’re harnessing a similar idea within SRS: the learner gets to _speak freely_ and still have their output checked.

**Automation:** Thanks to LLMs, generating and evaluating open prompts is feasible:

- **Prompt generation:** Use an LLM to create a scenario or question based on a target item. For example, if the target grammar is the subjunctive or a conditional, the LLM might generate a question like _“¿Qué harías si ganaras la lotería?”_ (“What would you do if you won the lottery?”) to prompt use of the conditional. If the target vocab is a word like _“procrastinate”_, the LLM could produce a question _“¿Cómo evitas procrastinar cuando tienes mucho trabajo?”_ (“How do you avoid procrastinating when you have a lot of work?”). These are **open questions** – there’s no single correct answer, but they compel the learner to use the target language actively.
    
- **Prompt format:** The prompt could be a direct question or an instruction for a short monologue. Always delivered in TL via TTS, possibly with a short silence after to indicate it’s the learner’s turn.
    
- **Evaluation criteria:** Decide what you want the LLM to check. Typical criteria:
    
    - Did the learner’s response **address the question/prompt** meaningfully?
        
    - Did they use the **target word or structure** (if the goal was to practice a specific item)?
        
    - Was the grammar and pronunciation acceptable for B1–B2 level (or are there major errors)?
        
    - Overall, would a native speaker understand the response and find it appropriate?
        

After the learner speaks, the speech is transcribed (ASR). The LLM can then be prompted with something like: _“Here is the question (in TL) and the learner’s answer (transcribed). Analyze if the answer is correct/appropriate and uses [target feature] correctly. Provide feedback.”_ The feedback can be given to the learner (“Great! You correctly used the past tense.” or “I understood you, but you missed using the new word – try including it next time.”), and the card can be marked as passed or to “repeat” depending on how well they did.

**Example:** Suppose a learner recently learned the German idiom _“ins Wasser fallen”_ (to fall into the water, meaning plans get canceled). A scenario prompt might be:

- **Prompt (TTS in German):** _“Stell dir vor, du hast eine Grillparty geplant, aber es regnet den ganzen Tag. Was würdest du über die Party sagen?”_ (“Imagine you planned a barbecue party but it’s raining all day. What would you say about the party?”) – This prompt is hinting at the idiom (the party fell into the water = got ruined).
    
- **Learner’s response (spoken):** _“Ich würde sagen, die Party ist ins Wasser gefallen.”_ (“I’d say the party fell through.”)
    
- **LLM evaluation:** The AI recognizes the learner correctly used the idiom _“ins Wasser gefallen”_. It might respond with positive feedback and mark the card as successful. If the learner had responded differently (or incorrectly), the LLM could judge if the response still made sense or if it failed to use the target expression.
    

Another example for a grammar point:

- **Prompt (French TTS):** _“Parlez de ce que vous avez fait le week-end dernier.”_ (“Talk about what you did last weekend.”) – This prompt expects usage of the **passé composé** (past tense) which the learner is practicing.
    
- **Learner responds** describing their weekend in French. The LLM checks that they indeed used past-tense forms and that the sentences are coherent. It gives feedback on any mistakes (e.g. wrong past participle agreement) and the card’s rating could depend on how many errors were present.
    

**Considerations:** Open-ended prompts are **harder to grade** objectively (since there isn’t a single answer), but an LLM can approximate a tutor’s judgment. For SRS scheduling, you might mark these cards as “passed” if the learner’s response was on-topic and mostly correct, or “again” if they significantly struggled. The goal here is _practice_, so even if it’s not a strict right/wrong, incorporating these cards can greatly enhance speaking fluency and confidence. They turn flashcard review into a mini speaking rehearsal.

**Scalability:** You can auto-generate many scenario prompts by feeding your list of target items to an LLM with instructions to create speaking questions. Since these don’t require manual curation, you avoid high-effort crafting. And because the prompts are based on authentic usage or likely scenarios, they remain relevant to real communication. Learners get **varied practice** – one card might be a cloze or definition (precise recall of a word), and the next might be an open question using that word (free-form usage). This combination solidifies knowledge: first memorize the item, then actually _use_ it in speech.

---

**Implementation Advice Summary:** All the above strategies can be mixed and matched in a balanced SRS deck. To implement at scale, leverage automation at each step:

- Use **LLMs to generate content** (cloze selections, questions, definitions, transformation instructions, open prompts) in batches from your source material.
    
- Use **Google TTS** to voice the prompts for listening. Ensure the voice is clear and at a suitable speed for B1–B2 comprehension.
    
- Use **Speech Recognition + GPT** to handle user responses. The speech-to-text engine (e.g. Google Speech API) will convert spoken answers to text, and an OpenAI GPT model can then compare against expected answers or evaluate correctness with natural language understanding. This combo allows acceptance of phrasing variations and nuanced feedback, rather than only exact matches.
    

Finally, prioritize **active recall** in all card types. Research and experience show that retrieving answers from memory (especially speaking them) strengthens learning far more than passive review. In fact, the Pimsleur method’s success was built on having learners _produce_ answers aloud under time pressure, rather than just recognizing them. By adopting these audio-based, speaking-heavy strategies, your SRS will not only help users remember thousands of words and patterns, but also train them to _use_ them confidently in speech – all without relying on translations or multiple-choice shortcuts. Each review session becomes a mini conversation with the language, which is exactly what serious learners need for B1→B2 and beyond.
