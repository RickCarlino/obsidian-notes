## **Pre-Onboarding (Before Day 1)**

- **Gather Available Info:**
    - Research the company’s products, customer value propositions, and any public documentation.
    - Review the team’s online presence (e.g., wiki pages, repositories, internal tools) if accessible.
- **Set Up Your Note System:**
    - Choose your preferred tool (e.g., Logseq, Markdown files, a digital journal) to keep daily notes and observations.
- **Prepare Mentally:**
    - Remind yourself of the “Chesterton’s Fence” principle—resist the urge to fix things until you understand why they are the way they are.
    - Adopt a mindset of curiosity and humility.

## **Day 1: Getting Started**

- **Establish Your Workspace:**
    - Set up your workstation and local development environment.
    - If onboarding documentation is lacking, note every step to later propose improvements.
- **Initial Introductions:**
    - Meet your immediate teammates (even brief hello’s count).
    - Identify key contacts (your manager, team leads, and any designated onboarding buddies).
- **Learn the Landscape:**
    - Browse existing documentation, code repositories, and internal tools.
    - Get a rough sense of the project’s history (even using tools like Gource, if appropriate).

## **Week 1: Laying the Foundation**

- **Meet with Your Manager:**
    
    - **Discuss Goals:** Ask about the 90-day and 1-year plans for the team.
    - **Clarify Role Expectations:** Understand what success looks like for you in this role.
- **Schedule Introductory 1:1s:**
    
    - **Team Members & Peers:** Learn what each person is working on, their pain points, and what they appreciate about the current processes.
    - **Non-Technical Stakeholders:** Set up brief meetings with people in sales, product, support, or design to grasp the “why” behind the product.
- **Begin Active Listening:**
    
    - Focus on absorbing how the team currently works and why certain processes exist.
    - Avoid suggesting major changes or new technologies until you have full context (a good rule is to wait at least 90 days before proposing significant rewrites or process overhauls).
- **Take and Organize Notes:**
    
    - Document your observations in daily entries or a weekly folder structure.
    - Note who does what, why certain decisions were made, and any areas that seem unclear.
- **Small Contributions:**
    
    - Identify low-risk tasks (e.g., fixing minor bugs or updating docs) to familiarize yourself with the codebase and development process.
    - If you make a “token” commit (even if it’s just documentation), ensure it demonstrates your ability to deliver without being overly showy.

## **Weeks 2–4: Deepening Your Understanding**

- **Expand Your 1:1s:**
    
    - **Dive Deeper:** Ask colleagues what they believe is the single most important thing you should know.
    - **Focus on Work Processes:** Keep conversations work-centric—learn about project histories, challenges, and existing practices without prying into overly personal areas.
- **Map the System & Processes:**
    
    - Review architectural documents and read code to build a mental map of the system.
    - Consider visualizing the code history if it helps understand the evolution of the project.
- **Document Your Learnings:**
    
    - Continue updating your notes with insights from meetings and observations.
    - Start drafting improvements for onboarding docs if you notice gaps.
- **Observe Team Dynamics:**
    
    - Identify informal influencers and learn the “pecking order” beyond the org chart.
    - Be careful not to challenge legacy processes prematurely; ask “why” before suggesting alternatives.
- **Engage Publicly:**
    
    - When asking questions, consider using public channels (like team Slack) so that others can learn from your queries.
    - Avoid coming off as overly critical or arrogant—curiosity and a genuine desire to understand are key.

## **First 90 Days and Beyond: Earning Impact**

- **Reassess and Prioritize:**
    - Review your notes and identify where your expertise can add strategic value.
    - Gradually propose improvements—but first, ensure you have the buy-in from key stakeholders.
- **Build Cross-Functional Relationships:**
    - Schedule follow-up meetings with non-developer peers (e.g., product managers, customer support) to understand broader business needs.
    - Use these relationships to help bridge the gap between technical execution and business objectives.
- **Share Your Insights:**
    - If appropriate, publish internal blog posts or summaries of what you’ve learned to help shape team practices.
    - Consider contributing to the evolution of onboarding documentation so that future hires benefit.
- **Focus on Long-Term Goals:**
    - Stay aligned with the manager’s vision and the company’s strategic objectives.
    - Demonstrate your ability not just to deliver code, but also to understand and contribute to the business strategy.
- **Keep Listening:**
    - Continue to listen more than you speak, especially in meetings.
    - Earn trust by asking thoughtful questions and by being collaborative in proposing changes.

## **Additional Considerations**

- **Respect the Past:**
    - Acknowledge that legacy systems exist for reasons. Don’t dismiss “legacy code” as inherently bad; instead, learn its history.
- **Stay Humble & Patient:**
    - Even if you have deep expertise, recognize that each organization has its own nuances.
    - Avoid being the “new senior guy” who immediately suggests radical changes.
- **Balance Visibility with Caution:**
    - While it’s important to be visible (through demos or early contributions), ensure that you build credibility by fully understanding the context first.
