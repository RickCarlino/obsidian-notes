# STAR Interview Questions

1. Only tell stories. That's the only way you answer.

2. Situation
3. Task
4. Action
5. Result

Modified:
6. Problem
7. Action
8. Outcomes

Accomplishes and Challenges I've faced:
- [ ] Practice STAR questions based on the question list.
- [ ] Watch or read a summary of the staff engineer book.
- [ ] Go through your ticket list and pick up themes for STAR interviews.
- [ ] Go through Q4/Q1 plans and talk about how you built stuff out.
- [ ] Print out an hour-by-hour summary of the interview with names and times
 - [ ] Design a URL shortener
 - [ ] Project retrospective: Think of a past project and how you handled.
 - [ ] Do these: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-system-design-interview-questions-and-answers/
 - [ ] Do all of these https://igotanoffer.com/blogs/tech/system-design-interviews
 - Conflict
 - Pressure
 - Difficulty
 - Managerial disagreements

## Rusty / Out of Practive
- Database sharding for the different database types
- Internal vs. external networking on Google Cloud
- Columnar databases
- Application webservers and their roles as load balancers
- Redis, esp. Redis clustering
- Most common GCS Machine types with regard to memory and storage (SSD, high RAM, etc..)
- CDN designs, specifically within Google Cloud
- (if time allows) Revisit the twitter video [here](https://igotanoffer.com/blogs/tech/system-design-interviews)
- Functional vs. Non-functional requirements

Don't say what you *would* do. Explain what you *did* do.

### Questions You Are Encouraged to Ask

- ‚ÄúAsk about the vision.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúAsk about our monetization strategy.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúAsk about our culture.‚Äù
- _(More generally, the article encourages you to ask:)_ ‚ÄúWhat do you like? What don‚Äôt you like? Ask follow-up questions.‚Äù

# The Seven Principles of Working at Discord

**By Wumpus - April 2, 2024**

When Discord was just an idea ‚Äì baby Wumpus, you could say ‚Äì our CEO, Jason Citron, asked an important question: **‚ÄúHow do we create a place where people can do their best work and be happy?‚Äù**

Over time, our team has grown, and we‚Äôve learned what makes working at Discord special. These **seven principles** guide us every day!

---

## 1. Cultivate Belonging

Take time to know your teammates and find common ground. Remember, we all have the same goal. **Start with trust, assume good intent, and try to understand others before judging.**

## 2. Deliver for Customers

Make things that truly help the people who use Discord. **Understand what they need and create solutions just for them.** Don‚Äôt worry about what competitors are doing ‚Äì focus on making Discord better!

## 3. Surprise & Delight

Small details make a big difference. **Add special touches that bring joy to people.** This applies to your work and how you interact with your team!

## 4. Debate, Decide, Commit

If you make a decision, **listen to others, use data, and have open discussions.** Once a decision is made, support it and make it great ‚Äì even if it wasn‚Äôt your first choice.

## 5. Progress Over Perfection

Big things start small. **Think long-term, break ideas into steps, and get started.** Aim for 80% great rather than waiting for 100% perfect. Move fast while still making great things!

## 6. Embrace the Brutal Facts

Take risks and **don‚Äôt be afraid to change course if something isn‚Äôt working.** Look at the facts and data to guide your choices. Learn from both success and failure.

## 7. Strive for Excellence

Do work you‚Äôre proud of every day. **Keep learning, ask questions, improve yourself, and help your team grow too.**

## How These Principles Shape Discord

These ideas have helped shape Discord into what it is today. 

For example, we‚Äôve made big decisions that changed our future. We also add fun little surprises to the app ‚Äì like special sound effects and animations that pop up when you least expect them.

No matter where you work ‚Äì whether in our San Francisco office or on a farm with your chickens (maybe you even use Discord to talk to them?) ‚Äì these principles help us do our best work.

## Apply These Principles in Life!

You don‚Äôt have to work at Discord to use these ideas. **They can help in everyday life, too!** Personal growth is just as important as career growth.
