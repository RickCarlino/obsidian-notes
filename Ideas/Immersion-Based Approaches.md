## Criticism

 * Some have argued that Krashen's theory is not testable (why not?).
 * Often used in the Japanese language learning community, where many learners have listening-only goals (media consumption, anime)
	 * Counter point: Although speaking can indirectly assist in language acquisition, the ability to speak is not the _cause_ of language learning or acquisition. Instead, [comprehensible output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensible_output "Comprehensible output") is the _effect_ of language acquisition.
