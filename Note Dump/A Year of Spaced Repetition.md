# Background Terminology
- Spaced repetition
- Clusters
- Co-locations
- word frequency lists
- Sentence mining
# My Story

- My history with SRS
	- iknow.jp (formerlly smart.fm)
	- old school Memrise
- Idea in college
	- Mechanical turk
- ten year gap
- LLM prototype
- TOPIK progress
	- Korean is hard
	- My schedule is worse
# Why It's Promising
- LLMs do not provide comparable quality compared to a teacher or tutor, but:
	- Provide a higher *volume* of education
	- Eliminates negative social aspects of teaching
		- Never get tired of the same question
		- *Truly* adhere to the "no stupid questions" mindset.
# Unwarranted Concerns
- Incorrect LLM output
- Pronounciation APIs
- 
# Bad Ideas I See People Try
- Looking for pronunciation APIs
- Translating from English to target language
- AI "Language Exchange" partners
	- These all suck. They speak awkward English-centric phrases and repetitively ask the same questions. You can only talk about your day so many times.
- Over emphasizing the importance of input-based approached

# Good Ideas Other People are Building
- Readlang/Kimchi reader/ migaku type apps.
- 
# Failed Ideas I Tried
- Machine-assisted grading for spaced repetition
- Learning words in isolation
# My Most Successful Prompts
- Sentence equivalence
- Writing prompt generation
- Cluster generation
# What Works?
- "Sentence mining", but to a point
- "Cluster generation" is helpful.
- Setting timers
# What Doesn't Work?
 - Don't use long sentences in an SRS - use that time to consume content instead.
# Failed Experiments
 - Objects (physical nouns) can still be learned in isolation.
 - Over-focusing on grammar
# Still Not Sure
- Conjunctions are not well suited to SRS, it seems.
	- Less true in 2025 as my cluster generator improves
# Future Experiments
- Really long cards with comprehension questions (like the TOPIK listening test)
# SRS Cards aren't Pokemon
TODO
# Learnings
- Quantity over quality. "SRS Cards aren't Pokemon". Delete hard cards and focus on volume.

# Promising Developments
- LLMs need to get faster
- Text to speech and speech to test are usable, but speed, accuracy and affordability still has room for improvement
- That one podcast app that slices and translates podcasts
