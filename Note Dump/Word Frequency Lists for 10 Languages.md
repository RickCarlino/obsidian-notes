# Top Languages Studied by English Speakers and Word Frequency Lists

Based on available data (defaulting to U.S. sources for lack of global figures), the nine most commonly studied foreign languages by English speakers are **Spanish**, **French**, **German**, **Mandarin Chinese**, **Italian**, **Japanese**, **Russian**, **Arabic**, and **Portuguese** ([Most spoken languages in the world and interesting linguistic statistics](https://www.rumblerum.com/most-spoken-languages-in-the-world/amp/#:~:text=9.%20Russian%3A%200.14,students%20enrolled)) ([Most spoken languages in the world and interesting linguistic statistics](https://www.rumblerum.com/most-spoken-languages-in-the-world/amp/#:~:text=4.%20Chinese%3A%202.13,students)). We include **Korean** as the tenth language (due to its rising popularity). Below, each language section provides three examples of word frequency lists that meet the criteria: derived from large or academic corpora (general vocabulary, not niche), directly viewable online (no sign-ups or file downloads required for viewing), and from reputable, non-spam sources. For each list, we note relevant details such as the corpus size, source, or compilation method.
