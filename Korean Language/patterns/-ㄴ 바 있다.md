### Notes
 - Billy claims this to be one of his most advanced overviews. I would agree.
 - I find this in news articles often.
 - It's a "fancier" replacement for a lot of more commonly used particles like a thing (것 ) event (일) event (경우) or method (줄).
	 - I think it might also be used to replace 적.
		 - 대회에서 금메달을 목에 건 바 있습니다.
 - Literary use only.
