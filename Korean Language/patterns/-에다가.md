This ending has many meanings, but I will focus on the meaning that I hit when opening a random page: "Express a meaning where one things adds to another".

I found a [good explanation on Korean StackExchange](https://korean.stackexchange.com/a/7159/325) that says if 에 means "at", 에다가 can be though of as "on to". The example in the question was "길에다 토하면" (if you throw up "onto" the street).

This one is too "nuance-y" so I am not going to focus on speaking much. No example sentences yet. Worth talking about with a tutor or exchange partner.
