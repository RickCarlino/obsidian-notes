It looks like it's already February of 2025, and I was running behind schedule on writing this article. Seeing as I've written year-in-review articles for so many years, I'd rather write this article quickly and get it out rather than break the streak that I've had. This year was a great year for me. I got lots of time to spend with my family, and I also had a very fun vacation in Korea for two weeks.I continue to work on Koala Cards, my open source project, and it's been very rewarding seeing it slowly mature. I still do not have a ton of users, but I do have some folks who have started using the app, which is fun to see.Aside from my trip to Korea, I also did a business trip to San Francisco to spend some time with my team at work. In terms of long distance running, I did far less running in 2024 than I did in 2023. The only real notable running event was when I served as a volunteer at the Great Western Half Marathon. No races other than that, though.Aside from Koala cards, I did do a few other fun open source projects like a simplex chatbot, a fourth programming language inspired stack manipulation game, and a TypeScript port of the FSRS spaced repetition algorithm.I spent a lot of time in 2020 for learning Korean, and I was able to pass the TOPIK exam with a score of 3.In 2025, I'm going to keep studying Korean, and I plan to take the test again in April. I really hope I get a better score this time and keep growing in this area. Learning Korean is fun on an intrinsic level, and it also gives me motivation to keep going on my koala cards project. I'll see you in the next video.My son has had a growing interest in STEM and this has been rewarding for me also since I get to share my passion for software development with him. As far as reading goes, I read a Korean history book and I read the famous paper about the 10,000 hour rule. Outside of reading, I learned a lot. I've been learning the OpenAI API quite well because of my involvement with Koala.In a nutshell, 2024 was a relaxing year of spending time with friends and family and enjoying hobbies. When I look forward to 2025, I think I want to spend the year getting serious about running again, like I did in 2023. I've already registered for a few races, and I'm hoping I can set some personal records. In terms of growing my Korean skills, I think it's time for me to push myself beyond just taking the TOPIK exam and doing some sort of project that pushes me to actually start using my Korean language skills, which have matured significantly in the past year. I'm not sure what that project will look like, but I think it's worth investigating.
