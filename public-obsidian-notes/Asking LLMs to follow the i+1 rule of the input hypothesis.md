input: 책상 위에 필통이 있어요

We're going to play a game that uses the i+1 concept from the immersion hypothesis.
You will take the input sentence above and create as many new sentences as possible, but you must follow these rules:

1. You can change anything about the sentence (words, grammar usage, conjunctions, patterns, etc..), but there can only be one change in total. This is i+1, remember.
2. The sentence needs to be realistic.
3. The sentence must follow the rules of the language in terms of grammar
4. Your output must be in the following format: "Korean sentnece / literal translation"

Ready? Go!
