"As you verb..."
As you know/see

- 알다시피 이건 내가 산 컴퓨터야.  
  "As you know, this is the computer I bought."

- 보시다시피 고양이가 저보다 더 커졌어요.  
  "As you can see, the cat has grown bigger than me."

- 들었다시피  
  "As you have heard"

- 저번에 말했다시피  
  "As I said last time"

## Watch Out!
If you put 하다 after it, it has a completely different meaning. See: [[-다시피 하다]]
