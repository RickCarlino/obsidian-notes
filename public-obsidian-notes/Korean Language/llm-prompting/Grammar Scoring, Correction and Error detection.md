### Introduction

The ability for LLMs in language learning software to detect, correct and score grammar mistakes in language learning can be extremely for both language learners.

Such features provide students help in specific areas similar to that provided by a teacher. This help is available all the time, with many advantages (and disadvantages) over human-assisted language learning. 

LLMs can provide repetitive feedback that would not be possible in a person-to-person context. Many aspects of LLM-based learning can reduce stigma and embarrassment experienced by students, thereby increasing a students actual time spent practicing a langue.
 
### Applications

- Many spaced repetition systems, such as Anki, require a student to subjectively score their performance. Remove the need for self-grading in spaced repetition systems via automated scoring can make learning less subjective and more efficient.
- Classify and categorize a speakers errors to assist teachers in building individualized curriculum for students.
	- Track and correct user input to create records of a learners language shortcomings.
	- Generate new material that exposes existing shortcomings in a student's vocabulary or grammatical comprehension.
	- Explain why a mistake is incorrect to improve overall understanding.
