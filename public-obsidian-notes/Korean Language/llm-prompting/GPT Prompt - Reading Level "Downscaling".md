One way to better understand a text without translating it is to "downscale" the reading level.

Here's an example prompt:
```
<PASTE TEXT HERE>

---

Please re-write this text so that I, a Korean language learner at the B1 skill level, can understand it.
```

The output will be much easier to understand. You can read this version first, then proceed to the advanced version.
