a new feature incorporating interactive, situation-based learning. This feature will complement our existing spaced repetition system (SRS) by adding a new type of card, tentatively named "Interactive Scenario Cards" (ISC). These cards will focus on practical language use in specific situations, providing users with a more immersive learning experience.
#### Feature Description

**Interactive Scenario Cards (ISC):** Unlike traditional flashcards, ISCs are one-sided and present the user with a situation and a goal. For example, the card might describe a scenario where the user is at a convenience store with the goal of telling the clerk they wish to purchase and load a transit card with 20,000 Korean Won.

After reading the scenario, the user will engage in a simulated conversation with the app, powered by our language learning model (LLM). The conversation will have a limited number of exchanges, designed to guide the user towards achieving the stated goal.

**Assessment and Feedback:** Upon completion of the interaction, the LLM will evaluate whether the user has successfully met the goal based on the exchanges. Users will receive a pass/fail assessment along with constructive feedback, including grammar corrections and suggestions for improvement.
