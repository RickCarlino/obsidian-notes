Mnemonics are a useful way to improve memorization of difficult words. This is a strategy I have tried, with varying levels of success. This is not as straightforward of a task as it might seem, since most LLMs struggle to meta-analyze the structure of the words provided (ask an LLM how many R's are in the word 'strawberry').
