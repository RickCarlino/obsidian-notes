### January 2024
  - Not much, huge storm, keeping chickens

## On Rotation - Low Focus
 - Career plan work
 - Year-in-review prep
 - Kimchi reader vocab list pruning
 - Koala long-term feature backlog
- Teach Mario stuff
- Stretch
## On Rotation - High Focus

 - HT Voice Room
 - Dual N Back
 - Watch YT Dev tuts on Kimchi Reader, [currrent](https://youtu.be/Gt40VneLdX4?si=xR9p3EotN7Gy6sHm)
 - Textbook Reading / Korean class homework
 - Koala-based career dev (tests, refactors, tools)
 - Readlang
 - Use Koala
## Idea
 - Watch dev tut at 0.5x on Kimchi
 - Read in Readlang, ask questions
 - Re-watch a few times or loop on long run
