## Off Rotation, Under Consideration

#### Looking at 2023 Goals

#### Continuing Korean Studies
Write a paragraph in Korean about all my Korean language studies.
#### KoalaSRS Progress
- Switch from SQLite to Postgres
- Switch from SM-2 to FSRS
- Add multi-lingual support
- TODO Look at release notes / PRs

#### February 2024

 - Gave a talk at Fox.Build AI night
 - OBS Live stream OpenSCAD
 - Birthday
 - Emily play
 - Port FSRS to TS / New scheduler
 - Toy SRS app
 - Learned about k-means clustering / vector embeddings
 - First email conversation with a Koala user
### January 2024
  - Not much, huge storm, keeping chickens
  - The month was basically a long COVID infection, a blizzard and the Worth national death march project.
  - Registered for TOPIK, Hanijemi Korean class, iTalki tutoring
## On Rotation - Low Focus
 - Koala long-term feature backlog (Current: curated content)
 - Stretch
 - Year-in-review prep
 - Career plan work
 - Teach Mario stuff
 - (15 dec) Kimchi reader vocab list pruning (Continuing [[Tangible Noun Vocab List]] for after grammar list in class)
## On Rotation - High Focus

 - HT Voice Room
 - (15 dec) Koala-based career dev (tests, refactors, tools)
 - Readlang OR Kimchi Reader reading ([Current](https://nextjs-ko.org/docs/getting-started/installation))
 - Dual N Back
 - Textbook Reading / Korean class homework
 - Use Kimchi Reader => YT Dev tuts => [currrent](https://youtu.be/Gt40VneLdX4?si=xR9p3EotN7Gy6sHm)
 - Use Koala

## Idea
 - Watch dev tut at 0.5x on Kimchi
 - Read in Readlang, ask questions
 - Re-watch a few times or loop on long run
