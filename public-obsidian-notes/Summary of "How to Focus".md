**NOTE:** I am writing this summary as I read the book therefore it is in an incomplete and unedited state.

The book is a heavily abridged translation of John Cassianâ€™s fifth-century CE *Collationes*. As an abridged secular book, it covers the topic of focus and how to dutifully attain ones goals. Thusfar my opinion of the book is favorable and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed similar books, such as *Deep Work*. It is an extremely light read, even more than the book's outter appearance might suggest. Pages on the left side of the book contains the Latin translation and a parallel paraphrase translation on the right page.

Goals are attained through focus towards Scopos ("target") and Telos ("end"), which can be simplified into the concepts of desired end states and the immediate actions required to meet them.
