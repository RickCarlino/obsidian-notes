My main interest in large language models lies in their ability to help students learn languages more efficiently. I've listed several areas below where I think LLMs could be useful.

 - [[Example Sentence Generation]]
 - [[Sentence Deconstruction and Phrase Isolation]]
 - [[Phrase Equivalence Detection]]
 - [[Practice Prompt Generation]]
 - [[Mnemonic Generation]]
 - [[Grammar Scoring, Correction and Error detection]]
 - [[Comprehension Question and Drill Generation]]
