Sometimes when I ask ChatGPT to translate things from Korean to English, it tries very hard to make the sentences sound like natural English. This is generally a good thing, but in the context of language learning it's not a good thing because it does not capture the nuance of the grammar that's being translated. When I make flashcards from sentences that I have translated to English, I want all of the nuance of the Korean language to be captured, and I don't really care if it sounds like a very fluent English sentence. The conversation below shows how you can adjust ChatGPT output to give more attention to nuance rather than fluency.

Me: 
```
이미 제가 다 했단 말이에요.
그건 안 해도 된단 말이에요.
내 옷이 더 예쁘단 말이야.
저도 요즘 썸타고 있단 말이에요.
나야 말로 미안해.
그거야말로 시간 낭비예요.


Please translate these. They're from a youtube video that teaches the -말이다 grammar pattern (keep that in mind when you translate).
```

Chat GPT:
```
Here are the translations for the sentences using the -말이다 grammar pattern, which is used to emphasize a statement in a somewhat assertive manner:

json

{
  "이미 제가 다 했단 말이에요.": "I already did everything.",
  "그건 안 해도 된단 말이에요.": "You don't need to do that.",
  "내 옷이 더 예쁘단 말이야.": "My clothes are prettier.",
  "저도 요즘 썸타고 있단 말이에요.": "I'm also seeing someone these days.",
  "나야 말로 미안해.": "I'm truly sorry.",
  "그거야말로 시간 낭비예요.": "That's truly a waste of time."
}

These sentences use the -단 말이다 pattern to assert the speaker's point more strongly or to emphasize the truth of their statements.

```
Me:

```
Maybe, instead of targetting a translation that sounds like English, instead try a more literal translation style.
ChatGPT

Certainly! Here’s a more literal translation of the sentences, capturing the nuances of the -말이다 grammar pattern which emphasizes or asserts the speaker's statements:

json

{
  "이미 제가 다 했단 말이에요.": "I'm saying that I've already done it all.",
  "그건 안 해도 된단 말이에요.": "I'm saying that you don't need to do that.",
  "내 옷이 더 예쁘단 말이야.": "I'm saying that my clothes are prettier.",
  "저도 요즘 썸타고 있단 말이에요.": "I'm saying that I've been flirting these days too.",
  "나야 말로 미안해.": "It's me who is truly sorry.",
  "그거야말로 시간 낭비예요.": "That is truly a waste of time."
}

This translation tries to preserve the explanatory and emphatic tone inherent to the -단 말이다 form.
