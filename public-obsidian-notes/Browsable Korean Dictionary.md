### About This Version

The Korean government hosts an [official dictionary of the Korean language](https://opendict.korean.go.kr). This version has been reformatted into a **browsable** format that is **sorted into three difficulty levels**. 

I made this version because I wanted the ability to browse the dictionary and felt that the website did not do a good job of allowing that. I was also dissatisfied with the quality and availability of hard copy dictionaries available in the US.
### Special Thanks

Special thanks to Reddit user /u/Zhivago for converting the [XML dump](https://github.com/spellcheck-ko/korean-dict-nikl-krdict/tree/master) of the dictionary to JSON and sorting by difficulty.
