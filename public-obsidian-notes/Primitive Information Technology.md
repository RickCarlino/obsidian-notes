I'm fascinated by information technologies that pre-date the information age and do not rely on digital computers. Devices like slide rules and card filing systems made it possible for humans to perform complicated tasks in pre-computer times.
### What Counts as Information Technology?

For the sake of this article, I will refer to information technology as a tool that stores, transmits or processes information. 

### What Makes an Information Technology Primitive

I'm going to use a very broad definition of "primitive" here. Anything that lacks a solid state transistor is fair game. This gives us a broad range of technologies, from things as simple as cuneiform to more advanced technologies like the telegraph.
