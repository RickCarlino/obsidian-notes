### Problems

#### Small Features

- Add notes
	- Make similar cards
	- Refresh definition
- Force 100% recitation of failed cards in same session.
- Add a "refresh" button to the final page of the "Add Cards" flow for when it doesn't come out quite right.
- Include the card front/back when sending transcription to Whisper (might reduce transcription error rate).
