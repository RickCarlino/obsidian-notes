I've been pretty happy with NextJS, mostly because of file-based routing. It's pretty much the only reason I started using the framework.

I decided to take a look at other frameworks that offer a similar approach: 

- [Deno Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/)
- [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/)
- [Remix](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/routes)
- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/routing#pages)
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing)
