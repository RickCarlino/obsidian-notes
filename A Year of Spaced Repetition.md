# What Works?
- Very long sentences make good speaking drills.

# What Doesn't Work?
 - Don't use long sentences in an SRS - use that time to consume content instead.

# Failed Experiments
 - Objects can still be learned in isolation.

# Future Experiments
- Really long cards with comprehension questions (like the TOPIK listening test)
# Learnings
- Quantity over quality. "SRS Cards aren't Pokemon". Delete hard cards and focus on volume.
